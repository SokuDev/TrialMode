		"lC This allows you to do new weather specific combos,<br>some characters like Youmu get a lot out of it by<br>obtaining more damaging BnBs and new limiting routes",
		"lD Sadly, Tenshi's combo game isn't really changed by<br>Monsoon since she doesn't have any practical Monsoon BnB<br>that is more optimal than her normal combos",
		"lA Nevertheless, an interesting interaction with Tenshi in<br>Monsoon is that her non-CH d22s and J2As will now allow<br>for combos where they would just knockdown normally",
